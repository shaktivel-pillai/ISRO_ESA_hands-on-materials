This notebook serves as an overview of the sunpy core library to highlight some of the functionality it provides and how it can be used within a scientific workflow with coordinated Solar Orbiter observations. 

Please get involved within the SunPy community! Join us on our [element.io](https://openastronomy.element.io/#/room/#sunpy:openastronomy.org) chat channel, [discourse](https://community.openastronomy.org/c/sunpy/5) 

## Running these notebooks in Google Colab

You can open any notebook in this repository directly in **Google Colab**:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ISRO-ESA-Heliophysics-Workshop/hands-on-materials/blob/main/solar-orbiter/sunpy/sunpy_intro.ipynb)

If using the Google Colab link you need to install the required Python packages (run once per Colab session)
After opening a notebook in Colab, insert a new code cell at the top and run:

```python
!pip -q install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ISRO-ESA-Heliophysics-Workshop/hands-on-materials/main/requirements.txt
```
